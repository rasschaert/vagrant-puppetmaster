Vagrant Puppetmaster
=================================
About
-----
It's pretty cool that Vagrant can provision machines with Puppet, but having a real Puppet master doing the provisioning in a Vagrant environment is even cooler. This project uses the puppet provisioning of Vagrant to set up a bare minimum puppet master server, which can then do the rest of the provisioning of both itself and the other VM's.

Is this project in a usable state?
-----------------------------
Hell no, this still needs a lot of work.
